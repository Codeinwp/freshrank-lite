== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does it work in other languages besides English? =
Yes! FreshRank works in any language that GPT-5 supports. That includes 50+ languages like Spanish, French, German, Portuguese, Italian, Japanese, Chinese, Korean, Arabic, and many more. The AI analyzes and generates drafts in your content’s original language.

= Do I need my own API keys? =
Yes, FreshRank uses your own OpenAI API key. This gives you full control and transparency. We provide detailed setup guides and cost estimation tools in the dashboard.

= Does the plugin store my content on external servers? =
Your content is temporarily sent to OpenAI’s API for analysis and updates, but FreshRank doesn’t permanently store your content on external servers.

All your articles, drafts, and analysis results are stored securely in your WordPress database on your own server. When you enable Google Search Console integration, only performance metrics are retrieved—not your content.

Your API keys are also stored securely in your WordPress database and never shared with third parties.
